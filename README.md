# TorAll

ðŸ§… TorAll is an anonymization utility tool that redirects all of the system's internet traffic through the TOR network.
It's an improved fork variation of the good old [TorGhost](https://github.com/SusmithKrishnan/torghost). It redirects all internet traffic through SOCKS5 tor proxy, preventing DNS leaks and unsafe packets exiting the system.

- Auto disables and re-enables IPv6

- Auto disables and re-enables UFW firewall

- Spoofs all ethernet and wireless MAC addresses by default

- Supports GNU/Linux distributions with systemd based on Debian/Ubuntu and Arch Linux
